# Trakko üë•

Trakko is a modern, fast, and privacy-focused web application for tracking event attendees. Built with the Fresh framework, it runs on Deno and leverages Deno KV for persistent, zero-configuration data storage. It's designed to be deployed effortlessly on Deno Deploy.

The user interface is designed to be simple, playful, and mobile-first, featuring a neo-brutalist inspired look with both light and dark modes.
